# Elements / Form Validation
Simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript project based on one of the designs from the “Weekly WebDev Challenge” Facebook group. My idea was to break down the page view into smaller elements and style them separately. Additionally, I wrote my own form validation in this project.

Here you can watch the elements live:
- input: https://marekjanik.github.io/elements/input/
- checkbox: https://marekjanik.github.io/elements/checkbox/
- button: https://marekjanik.github.io/elements/button/
- register form: https://marekjanik.github.io/elements/register-form/
